# Attendance-System-Using-Facial-Recognition
Attendance System Bases on Facial Recognition for Online Classes

Due to covid-19 we have been forced to conduct online classes earlier no one would have even thought of it. This project has digitize the process of attendance collection by using image processing techniques and will automatically update the attendance database.
 
To solve the problem which teachers face during online classes like a student using multiple email ids of friends to login and mark their attendance, be present at the starting and beginning of class only to get attendance or leave their system while teacher is presenting screen and teaching.

Two most important aspects of our system are face detection and face recognition. 

### For face detection MTCNN is used in this project.

### For the face recognition used the face_recognition module of python.

### Used Tkinter as the GUI tool.

Some of the features provided in the GUI are **Take attendance , Show attendance, Train, Add student data, Take screenshot**.

It also includes data entry, dataset training, face recognition and attendance entry in excel sheet. It can take attendance while ongoing class and using video streams(screenshot of meet) later also. 

Using this system, daily online attendance can be recorded effectively.
